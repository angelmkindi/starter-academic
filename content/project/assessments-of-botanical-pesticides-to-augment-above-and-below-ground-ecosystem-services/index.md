The overall goal of the project is to improve food security in Tanzania through the development and optimization of plant-based pest management technologies that are simple, effective, reliable, safe, low-cost and appropriate for the control of field and storage insect pests of legumes and cereal crops. An expansion into cereal pest management has been requested by our Farmers as a high priority objective as they are facing severe problems with fall armyworm, and more recently, locust outbreaks across eastern Africa are leading to severe losses. Farmers also recognise that plant-based technologies could help them enhance soil fertility and crop disease management. Thus, a further objective is to integrate above and below ground pest and disease management technologies and to increase crop resilience to facilitate natural plant defences against pest and diseases. To enable FRNs to increase research in these areas a further objective is to increase farmer learning through workshops, demonstrations and exchanges to help them understand the principles of AEI to grow more food more sustainably and to diversify their incomes, e.g. nonfood plant production of *Tephrosia vogelii* and other pesticida
