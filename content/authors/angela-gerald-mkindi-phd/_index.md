Angela Gerald Mkindi (PhD) is a Lecturer in the School of Life Sciences and Bio-engineering at the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST). She has a PhD in Sustainable Agriculture, with agroecology, environmental sciences and management background. Her research interests focus on sustainable production, through ecologically benign pest management approaches. She has worked to evaluate the use of pesticidal plants and harnessing ecosystem services in farmer fields. Her focus is in researching, implementing and consulting on sustainable crops pest management, ecosystem services in farmlands, organic agriculture and climate resilient farming approaches in Tanzania and beyond. She is passionate about collaborative research, with maximum involvement of farmers in all research stages, that is; problem identification, designing goals and approaches, evaluation and monitoring, feedback and planning. Itâ€™s from her strong commitment to smallholder farmers and their wellbeing, that she has facilitated the development of a Farmer Research Network to evaluate sustainable pest management and soil health improvement in the Hai district council-Tanzania. She is using the model in other farming systems interventions, with an optimism of creating a strong collaborative, bottom up and context based farming.
